# Creative Coding Major Assignment-Individual Task for Perlin noise and randomness

## Color Transition Animation Using Perlin Noise
Upon page load, an animation will start. Building on our group's code, I used Perlin noise values to gradually transition the main building's color from purple to black, symbolizing the shift from noon to dusk. Specifically, I used noise values to adjust the red and blue components of the purple channel while decreasing the brightness, achieving the color change of the building.
