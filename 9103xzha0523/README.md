# Creative Coding Major Assignment-Individual Task for Perlin noise and randomness
I choose perlin noise to drive my individual code, here is the detail instructions on the interact work.
## Color Transition Animation of the Main Building
Upon page load, an animation will start. Building on our group's code, I used Perlin noise values to gradually transition the main building's color from purple to black, symbolizing the shift from noon to dusk. Specifically, I used noise values to adjust the red and blue components of the purple channel while decreasing the brightness, achieving the color change of the building.

## Dynamic Effect of the Halo
The halo is positioned on the upper left side of the screen, dynamically adjusting its arc and thickness based on noise values. It appears behind the building, with a gradient sky and sea in the background, creating a harmonious and ethereal visual effect.
